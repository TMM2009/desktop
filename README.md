# Codespaces Desktop

Instructions to use Codespaces can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mN6PRvM4OCBaXGaO_-duLVfvvCL0M4HQY4BjEorn_dc/edit?usp=sharing).

The password for the `vscode` (default) user is `vscode`.

This repository contains a codespace pre-configured for CTF purposes. It has various tools installed, including:
* Firefox (`firefox`)
* GDB + GEF (`gdb`)
* Ghidra (`ghidra`)
* pwntools (`pwn`)
* ROPgadget (`ROPgadget`)
* zsteg (`zsteg`)
* Stegsolve (`stegsolve`)
* Audacity (`audacity`)
* RsaCtfTool (`rsactftool`)
* Recaf (`recaf`)

To use these tools, open the terminal (while in the desktop environment) and run the command listed next to each tool.

## Sagemath

Sagemath does not come pre-installed, but it can be easily installed with `sudo apt install sagemath`. For most purposes, however, using [sagecell.sagemath.org](https://sagecell.sagemath.org/) is sufficient.
